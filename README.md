# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression

A machine Learning based Multiple linear regression model to predict the rainfall on the basis of different input parameters. The input features includes pressure, temperature, humidity etc.

# Dataset Used
The dataset used is downloaded from Kaggle and is freely available. The dataset is named as "Austin weather dataset". The dataset is uploaded with the files.

# Methodology
1.Converting data in to the correct format to conduct experiments.
2. Make a good analysis of data and observe variation in the patterns of rainfall.
3. Finally, we try to predict the rainfall by separating data into training and testing. We apply various statistical and machine learning approaches(Multiple Linear Regression) in prediction and make apredictions.
